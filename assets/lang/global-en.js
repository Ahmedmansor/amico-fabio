But for the afternoon, I offer you two paths:\n\n🅰️ Option A (The Classic - Economy): The old Egyptian Museum in Tahrir Square. It's the historic museum, full of ancient charm, dust, and history (Indiana Jones style). Perfect for those who want to save money and see traditional Cairo.\n\n🅱️ Option B (The Future - VIP): The New GEM (Grand Egyptian Museum). It is the largest museum in the world, modern, shiny, and home to Tutankhamun's entire treasure. It costs more, but it's a world-class experience.\n\nNote: You will find the price difference in the price list. Choose what makes your heart beat!",
